> *I saw the idea in [Bitmap Logic Simulator](https://realhet.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/bitmap-logic-simulator/) and a bit simplified.*

## The Rules
![](https://i.imgur.com/yHLo71u.png)

### Rule 1: directly connected cells are the same wire
### Rule 2: the intersection of wires through a not-a-wire is a wire crossing
### Rule 3: the special pattern (including rotations) is a NOT gate
